XSS 2 - Reflected XSS + Phishing!
---------------------------------

Now when we successfully attacked the system with a Stored XSS attack, let's try another method - a Reflected attack!

Reflected attack take advantage of unsanitized data that is injected from the url, and passes it to the code.

If you want, you can browse through [this again](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29).

Our vector of attack is going to be like so:

1. Create a [phishing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phishing) page - a fake login page that have every login attempt send the credentials to your `serve` application. (you can user `serve` as a web server that will retrieve the fake page) 

2. Did you noticed the *welcome* message poping up once you login? use that to inject your script and have the fake login page open at the victim's site.

3. You are trying to steal the victim's password! make the new malicious flow as convincing as possible! 

.. 

..

You would be surprised how many people fall victim to these kind of attacks..

Another point that I should mention, that this method of attack not work on all users, but you will eventually get their *password* and not a *session*!

If (for example) they use the same password as their *gmail* account, you basically got access to their mail too - and from there - their whole life!
