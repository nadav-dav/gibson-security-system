Some cookies **cannot be read via scripts**.

We prevented an attacker for getting our precious user session, let's handle the client side.. we know our data is already corrupted, so we'll need to handle it unsanitized.

And now for some client side magic - find the difference between jQuery's `.html()` and `.text()`. Got it? well go on than! apply the change on your system!
