XSS 3 - Server Side XSS + Click jacking!
--------------------------------------

Are you ready? I have a secret to tell you..

There are a lot of companies that uses all sort of *debugging* parameters.
And there are all sort of scanners that tries to "guess" the parameter's name, and see if editing it affect the system.

Try to find the *debug* parameter! go over the code, and try your best to guess it, and see how it changes the system.

.. 

.

Found it? awesome! now for the fun part!

Use the vulnerability you just found to **inject a script file**, that will create this iframe:


```
 <iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/follow.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdefcon&amp;width=61&amp;height=35&amp;colorscheme=light&amp;layout=button&amp;show_faces=false" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border:none; overflow:hidden; width:61px; height:35px;" allowTransparency="true"></iframe>
```
This is a "Facebook follow" button, and if you edit your javascript just right, and add the right CSS, you can make is transparent and place it right on top of the "post" button - so when a user will try and post a message, he/her will "follow" you page!

Facebook followers are a great resource and worth a lot of money!

There are many companies that uses "click jacking" to sell *likes*.
