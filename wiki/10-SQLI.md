SQLI - or SQL Injection, is a really simple vector of attack and it is very common to find vulnerable applications.

In this section we will try to hijack a user account and log in as the victim.

To do that, first, [read about sqli attack](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_injection) (knowledge is power)!

Now that you're smart, try this:

1. Open your favourite text editor
2. Write down the victim's username
3. Log out and navigate to the login screen.
4. Now, here's the trick - Try to imagine what the SQL query looks like! (Don't look at the code just yet!)
5. Think about how to mess with it and try to login as the victim.
