XSS 3 - Come ON!
----------------

The road to hell if paved with good intensions..

This debug param has *got to go*!

**But**, the development team still needs to inject files for debug purposes.. 

1. First, **sanitize** the data that could be injected, think about how to do that..

2. Second, think of other ways to inject scripts that the development team could use *WITHOUT* compromising the application's security!
